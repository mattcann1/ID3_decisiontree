# ID3_decisiontree

In this repository an ID3 decision tree classifier is designed to classify the categorical dataset “Tic-Tac-Toe Endgame” and numerical dataset “Wine” from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The project is discretized into the following sections:
1. Design of an ID3 decision tree classifier reporting accuracy based on 10-times-10-fold cross validation.
    1. Design an ID3 decision tree classifier using Information Gain for the constrution of the tree for both datasets.
    1. Repeat Part 1 using Gain-Ratio instead of Information Gain. 

1. Analysis of attribute noise and class noise on ID3 decision tree classifier.

## Part 1

|   Dataset   |     Criteria     | Accuracy - Mean | Accuracy - STD |
|:-----------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|:--------------:|
| Tic-Tac_Toe | Information Gain |      84.88%     |      3.49      |
|     Wine    | Information Gain |      91.15%     |      7.04      |
